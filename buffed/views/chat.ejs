                        Calisthenics is a type of workout that uses a personâ€™s body weight with little or no equipment. The exercises involve movements that use large muscle groups, such as pushups. People typically perform these exercises at a moderate pace. They help to improve coordination, flexibility, and strength.

                        Analysis show that the most efficient training plan is 4 days of training and 3 days of rest. This way your muscles are trained often enough but you also have time to regenerate

                            The deadlift is a movement in which your hips hinge backward to lower down and pick up a weighted barbell or kettlebell from the floor. Your back is flat throughout the movement.
